### Instructions to run the code: 
Code is written in a script like format so one just have to run sequentially.

### Learning algorithm : 
The learning algorithm used is deep Q Learning. The structure of neural network is plain 3 layered network. 

### Results : 
Results are fairly good where at end of 3000 episode , Average Score: 14.78 is achieved. Moreover after around 600 steps highest performs is somewhat achieved.
For further graphical results the notebook can be checked.

### Further Improvements : 
One can take to bayesian hyperparameter optimisation, using convolutional units as feature extractor instead of dense units, dueling DQN, prioritized experience replay and Rainbow

### Note: 
I ran the code on workspace of udacity hence was not able to download weights but it can be seen in the code that it was generated.
