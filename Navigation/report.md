### Learning algorithm : 
The learning algorithm used is deep Q Learning. The structure of neural network is plain 3 layered network. 

### Results : 
Results are fairly good where at end of 3000 episode , Average Score: 14.78 is achieved. Moreover after around 600 steps highest performs is somewhat achieved.
For further graphical results the notebook can be checked.

### Further Improvements : 
One can take to bayesian hyperparameter optimisation, using convolutional units as feature extractor instead of dense units and dueling DQN.
